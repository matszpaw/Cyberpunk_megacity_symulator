Fantasy world simulation

in high fantasy setting the trbes function in state of eqilibium with nature. They have stable population and don't expand. Then gods decide to help them. Through sending powerful but chaotic amulets they aim to make fate of the tribes and nature surrounding them natunpredictable.


RULES:
1.simulation must be discrete and use of randomness to be minimalized

2.the only reaction is when you add a feature, the point is to create cascading ones

3.the symulation/game is about peaceful world where couple of powerful amulets spawn

4.every amulets has its own way to alter equilibrium, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse

5.important thing is the creation of equilibirum, then ways to destroy it in intresting ways
