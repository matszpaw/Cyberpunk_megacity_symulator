Fantasy world simulation

In high fantasy setting live trbes functioning as one with nature. They have stable population and don't expand. Then gods decide to help them. Through sending powerful but chaotic amulets they aim to make fate of the tribes and nature surrounding them natunpredictable.


RULES:
1.Simulation must be discrete and use of randomness to be minimalized

2.The world starts in the state of equilibirum

2.The only reaction is when you add a amulet

3.Every amulet has its own way to alter equilibrium, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse

4.The point is to create cascading reaction to the equilibium

ROADMAP:

1.Create tribe class and basic state of procudion/consumption equilibium sorrounding them.

2.Create amulet class and interactions_on_tick

3.idk.
