RULES:
#simulation must be discrete
#use of randomness to be minimalized
#the only reaction is when you add a feature, the point is to create cascading ones
#the symulation/game is about peaceful world where couple of powerful artifacts spawn
#every artifact has its own way to alter equilibrium,
#sometimes for the better,sometimes for the worse
#important thing is the creation of equilibirum, 
#then ways to destroy it in intresting ways
#the "tick" is created by passing features into lists inside objects
#simple ticker can be created by passing empty names into some dummy object
